Hello! I am a third year undergraduate student at New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study, working on a concentration in racial inequity, its historicization, related public policy, as well as how it impacts access to healthcare. I am also minoring in chemistry and social public policy. You can talk to me about policy in general, or immigration policy and healthcare policy in specific. I also am open to talking about biotechnology, artificial intelligence, the future of telemedicine and its impact on access. I am passionate about healthcare framed as a human right, and am working to envision a future where universally accessible healthcare is possible. 


Some of my relevant experiences includes working with international non-profit organizations, initiating vertically integrated projects on food access, and  a lot of _in vitro_ lab work. Over the past six years, I have worked on several projects in the wet lab setting; of this work, two of my projects have been recognized by Regeneron and Intel Science Fairs and funded by school-wide grants. Now I am working on transitioning towards public health resesarch as well as data access-related research. My current projects in progress include improving data infrustructure surrounding maternal community health, evaluating and improving the BORN (Birth Oximeter Routine for Newborns) in different countries, and also this website! 

I am constantly looking to learn and expand my knowledge in any field related to public health, technology, politics, and public policy.
